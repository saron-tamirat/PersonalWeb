               <p>A 100% positivity all the time is not gonna happen in a world full ot ups and down.perhaps that is what makes life enjoyable
                as anyone living in this world has encountered those two extremes (The highs and lows).I think and am pretty much
               sure that it's the way we handel those encounters that puts us in different levels.The conventional life advices that we hear - all the positive and happy
              self-help stuff we hear all the time is actuallyfixating on what we lack. </p>
                <p>
               The fixation on the positive-on whats better and whats supperior only serves to remind us over and over again
               of what we are not,of what we lack and of what we value the most.This is when to ask ourselves what we value the 
               most. What are the things that we give a damn about for us to feel useless and zero energy all teh time.<br>
               <p>
                Lets go over some of the shitty values
               </p> 
                <p><strong>‘Always being right’.</strong></p>
                <p>
                    We are all human beings.We misjudge,make poor desicions and can even be wrong at the most easiest thing.
                    we are pretty much wrong constantly.If you think you should always be right, mate you are blocking the way
                    from learning from your mistakes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    one thing for sure you cant be 100% right because you simply can't.If you think you should always be right even the
                    thought of being wrong stresses your mind out.Why stressing out over somerhing that cannot even be fullfilled !   
                </p>
                <p><strong>‘Material success’.</strong></p>
                <p>
                    If you measure your success based on how much money you make, how big your house is and on that 1M$ car
                    you drive , then you would probably find 0 answer about the meaning of life after u overcome that material thirst.
                    you used to do whatever it is  to build a huge house or drive a 1M$ car.so now since you got everythind on your palm it means
                    that you are basically working your ass of for nothing.  
                </p>
                <p><strong>‘pleasure’</strong></p>
                <p>
                    No one hate pleasure in any shape or form. But it is not a value to circle your life around. pleasure is the most superficial
                    form of life satisfaction. It is the easiest thing to obtain and so the easiest to lose.Just throw this shitty value and replace with the 
                    good once and it will eventually come as a by-product. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>‘staying positive’</strong></p>
                <p>
                    so there are people who measure their lives by the ability to be positive all the time .Well mothe nature doent't allow
                    that. you are going and hae to encounter a problem in your life.If you always think of positivity you are more likely to deny
                    the negativity than to facce them which enlarge the problem rather than solving it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    what you must is bring a positive out of the negative. Just express the negative emotions in a healthy manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                   problems are sense of meaningto our life.Denying them is to lead meaningless existance.
                </p>
                <br><br><br>
                <p>
                    Good values are reality based, socially constructive and achieved interally.
                    some of good values are honesty, creativity, spending time with loved once, self respect, working hard.
                    This are things u have a complete control over and donot need an external event to achieve them. <br>
                    As for the bad values like pleasure ,material success they are superficial and rely on external things.
                    Your need that alcohol to hit that pleasure. You need people to tell you that you are always right all the time.
                    You need a private jet and 1M$ car to feel complete.
                </p>
                <p><strong>so choose your values to be the best you!</strong></p>
